# stratum observer configuration

## SQLite
# stratum-observer can record stratum jobs to a SQLite database.
# Depending on the number of pools you connect to, this database
# can grow multiple megabyte per day. Make sure to rotate it from
# time to time.
#
# If "database_path" is included and not empty, stratum job recording
# to SQLite is enabled.
database_path = "stratum-observer.sqlite"

## postgresql
# stratum-observer can record stratum jobs to a PostgreSQL database.
# Depending on the number of pools you connect to, this database
# can grow multiple megabyte per day.
#
# If "postgresql_url" is included and not empty, stratum job recording
# to PostgreSQL is enabled.
postgresql_url = "postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname>"

## websocket
# stratum-observer offers a websocket sending out stratum job details
# as JSON messages. This is used to display jobs on a web interface.
#
# If "websocket_address" is included and not empty, websocket job 
# publishing is enabled. 
websocket_address = "127.0.0.1:57127"

## pools
# stratum-observer connects to multiple stratum pools. Currently, only
# stratum v1 pools are supported. Each list entry should have at least
# an endpoint (host:port), a unique name, a username. A password field
# is optional. Additionally, a max_lifetime can be specified in seconds
# after which the pool connection is dropped and a new connection is
# opened. 
pools = [
  { endpoint = "stratum.example.com:3333", name = "Example Pool", user = "user.worker", password = "45324" },  
]
